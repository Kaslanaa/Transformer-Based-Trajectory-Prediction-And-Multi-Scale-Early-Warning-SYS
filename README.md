# Transformer-Based-Trajectory-Prediction-And-Multi-Scale-Early-Warning-SYS
A novel method for trajectory prediction (SOTA performence) and warning system
We used transformer transfer learning for trajectory prediction based on the publicly available dataset on Kaggle (innovatively using trajectory transformation). The experimental results showed that using only one trajectory for training, the MSE tested with thousands of trajectories was less than 0.002, indicating excellent model performance. Based on this experimental result, we further designed an early warning system and comprehensively implemented the "infinite electronic fence technology".
